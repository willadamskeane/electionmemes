I'm Hillary Clinton. I have been proud and privileged to serve as first lady, as a senator from New York, and as secretary of state. I'm the granddaughter of a factory worker and the grandmother of a wonderful one-year-old child. And every day, I think about what we need to do to make sure that opportunity is available not just for her, but for all of our children. I have spent a very long time -- my entire adult life -- looking for ways to even the odds to help people have a chance to get ahead, and, in particular, to find the ways for each child to live up to his or her God-given potential.

I've traveled across our country over the last months listening and learning, and I've put forward specific plans about how we're going to create more good-paying jobs: by investing in infrastructure and clean energy, by making it possible once again to invest in science and research, and taking the opportunity posed by climate change to grow our economy.

At the center of my campaign is how we're going to raise wages. Yes, of course, raise the minimum wage, but we have to do so much more, including finding ways so that companies share profits with the workers who helped to make them.

And then we have to figure out how we're going to make the tax system a fairer one. Right now, the wealthy pay too little and the middle class pays too much. So I have specific recommendations about how we're going to close those loopholes, make it clear that the wealthy will have to pay their fair share, and have a series of tax cuts for middle-class families.

And I want to do more to help us balance family and work. I believe in equal pay for equal work for women, but I also believe it's about time we had paid family leave for American families and join the rest of the world.

(APPLAUSE)

During the course of the evening tonight, I'll have a chance to lay out all of my plans and the work that I've done behind them. But for me, this is about bringing our country together again. And I will do everything I can to heal the divides -- the divides economically, because there's too much inequality; the racial divides; the continuing discrimination against the LGBT community -- so that we work together and, yes, finally, fathers will be able to say to their daughters, you, too, can grow up to be president.

I'd like to call her. We need to address this today or we will be facing a huge Fox-generated media storm led by Palin et al. Did Bill tell you that on the receiving line of his second speech yesterday, he had the weirdest exchange ever when a woman loudly announced that her father 'circumcised Bin Laden!' What a claim to fame. Love to all. I'm still having problems with my blackberry. I'd like to respond to Ben Affleck. It has been brought to my attention that I kinda blew it on the Sri Lanka and Armenia statements. Be sure Bill doesn't act all nice. A little sternness is in order. How did you put that big smileycom on your email?? Here's my question: on this new berry can I get smiley faces? Not even the allure of Mother Moon in all her glory is unlikely to impress the PM. Everything is soon hard and not nearly as gratifying as planting your garden. Sure. I'll do, but didn't know that was appropriate. Oh, Pleeeze! They are beautiful but way out of my price rang! Amazing, isn’t it, what passes for news these days? If I want to knock a story off the front page, I just change my hairstyle. We must stop thinking of the individual and start thinking about what is best for society.



Probably my worst quality is that I get very passionate about what I think is right.



You show people what you're willing to fight for when you fight your friends.



In too many instances, the march to globalization has also meant the marginalization of women and girls. And that must change.



I'm not going to have some reporters pawing through our papers. We are the president.



Gay rights are human rights.



I have said publicly no option should be off the table, but I would certainly take nuclear weapons off the table.

Don’t let anybody tell you that it’s corporations and businesses that create jobs. 

Laws have to be backed up with resources and political will. There are rich people everywhere. We just can't trust the American people to make those types of choices. Government has to make those choices for people. If you have guns in your home, tell your parents to keep them away from you and your friends and your little brothers and sisters. I also believe that every new handgun sale or transfer should be registered in a national registry. It was not easy. My husband may have his faults, but he has never lied to me. I left my sunglasses in the limo. I need those sunglasses. We need to go back! The last time I actually drove a car myself was 1996. I believe in equal pay for equal work for women, but I also believe it's about time we had paid family leave for American families and join the rest of the world. I'm a progressive. But I'm a progressive who likes to get things done. I think that we have to look at the fact that we lose 90 people a day from gun violence. This has gone on too long and it's time the entire country stood up against the NRA. We need a new New Deal for communities of color. Well, I think that's pretty obvious. I think being the first woman president would be quite a change from the presidents we've had up until this point, including President Obama. Well, I can't think of anything more of an outsider than electing the first woman president. They're fine with big government when it comes to that. I'm sick of it. Of course, I love many things American, including the food. You know, I used to work in a Howard Johnson’s restaurant. God bless the America we are trying to create. Who is going to find out? These women are trash. Nobody’s going to believe them. If it were a movie, it would be Honey, I Shrunk the Surplus. If I didn’t kick his ass every day, he wouldn’t be worth anything. I’m not going to have some reporters pawing through our papers. We are the president. In the Bible it says they asked Jesus how many times we should forgive, and he said seventy times seven. Well, I want you to know that I’m keeping a chart. See how liberal I’m becoming! You stupid, stupid, stupid bastard. My God, Bill—how could you risk everything for that? If all that were proven true, I think that would be a very serious offense. This is not going to be proven true. I just don’t have any memory of that. We are going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good. Where is the God damn fucking flag! I want the God damn fucking flag up every morning at fucking sunrise. Fuck off! It’s enough I have to see you shit-kickers every day, I’m not going to talk to you too! Just do your God damn job and keep your mouth shut. If you want to remain on this detail, get your fucking ass over here and grab those bags! Stay the fuck back, stay the fuck back away from me! Don’t come within ten yards of me, or else!  Just fucking do as I say, okay. Where’s the miserable cock sucker! You fucking idiot. Come on Bill, put your dick up!  You can’t fuck her here! We're always going to argue about abortion. People can judge me for what I've done. I'm fully comfortable with who I am, what I stand for, and what I've always stood for. Voting is the most precious right of every citizen. You don't walk away if you love someone. You help the person. I for some reason started doing that in 1992, and I swear by it. I like live audiences, with real people - virtual reality is no substitute. You cannot have maternal health without reproductive health. And reproductive health includes contraception and family planning and access to legal, safe abortion. We must stop thinking of the individual and start thinking about what is best for society. I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas. I am, you know, adamantly against illegal immigration. I'm undaunted in my quest to amuse myself by constantly changing my hair. Women are the largest untapped reservoir of talent in the world. Showing up is not all of life - but it counts for a lot. There's a difference between fair game and playing games. Gay rights are human rights. Probably my worst quality is that I get very passionate about what I think is right. Human rights are women's rights, and women's rights are human rights. I'm too old to be a yuppie. I believe that the rights of women and girls is the unfinished business of the 21st century. I believe in transparency. Wealthy women have rights in every country. And poor women don't. Everybody has some dysfunction in their families. I have to defend my husband. Hard men present hard choices - none more so than Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia. Women standing up for each other is critically important. You have to be true to yourself. I have a lot of stamina and I have a lot of resilience. Freedom means the right of people to assemble, organize, and debate openly. Every nation has to either be with us, or against us. Those who harbor terrorists, or who finance them, are going to pay a price. You have to test your ideas in a public forum. Every marriage is a mystery to me, even the one I'm in. So I'm no expert on it. I have not supported same-sex marriage. I have supported civil partnerships and contractual relationships. The First Lady role is really difficult. It has no job description... You have to create it for yourself. It should never be a crime to be gay. Being gay is not a Western invention. It is a human reality. I can't stand whining. I take vitamins. I believe in a zone of privacy. Of course, parents are the most important people in a child's life. Egypt is a large, complex, very important country. I want to teach. I want to speak. I want to travel. I've had extraordinary good luck with my health, other than a broken elbow. I think I'm chronically exhausted. I wish I were taller and thinner but the hair you can do something about. I am someone who hopes for the best and prepares for the worst. Probably the Republicans. This is an incredibly complicated region of the world. It's becoming more complicated. And many of the fights that are going on are not ones that the United States has either started or have a role in. "I think we've got to understand the complexity of the world that we are facing, and no places more so than in the Middle East. Hardworking middle-class families need a raise, not a tax increase. My proposal is tougher, more effective and more comprehensive, because I go after all of Wall Street, not just the big banks. I couldn't have said it better myself. I think President Obama deserves more credit than he gets for what he's gotten done in Washington despite the Republican oppression. Well, the revolution never came. And I waited, and I've got the scars to show for it. I think the president's job is to do everything possible, everything that she can do, to lift up the people of this country. I don't take a back seat to anyone when it comes to progressive experience and progressive commitment. At the center of my campaign is how we're going to raise wages. But we are not Denmark. I love Denmark. We are the United States of America. Please come and make it clear that America's best days are still ahead. My friends, it is time to take back the country we love. This is a fight for the future. And it's a fight we must win together.
